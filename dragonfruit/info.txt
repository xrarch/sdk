--- misc technical notes, don't try to get useful info off this, its a scratchpad ---

== auto variables ==

autos/locals are stored in registers.
they are scoped per procedure.

some registers are off-limits.

reserved registers:

r0
r1
r2
r3
r4 - low level scratch
r31 - flags

all other registers from r5 to r30 are fair game, giving like 25 max auto variables or something
i could do fancy stuff for quantities above this
like store it on the stack, or something

but thats effort. so i just set a hard limit.
should be more than enough anyway.

== structs ==

struct sn
	4 Element1
	3 Element2
endstruct

will declare a struct called "sn"
this generates several constants, sn_Element1, and sn_Element2
you can use these directly like

object sn_Element1 + @

== tables ==

table tn
	"Hi!"
	2
	6
	0x53325
	4
endtable

will declare a table called "tn"
each of its elements is a "long" in this case, a 4 byte value
a string is stored as a pointer reference
