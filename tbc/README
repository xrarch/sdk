Tower Bootstrap Compiler

Tower -> C compiler for use in writing the real self-hosted compiler.
Won't be maintained after that compiler is complete, so this one is very
rudimentary, does little error checking, will readily let bad stuff fall
through to the C compiler, etc. Don't use this expecting a good time -- it's
purely temporary for use in developing the real compiler and its entire purpose
is to vanish as quickly as possible.
